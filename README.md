GPT Prompt new ways

### Always include the key works
- "Think hard about this"
- "Think deeply about this"
- "Think carefully"


### Engineering Mindset & Foundations
- Instead of thinking..                   Start thinking..
- What question should I ask?             What system should I design?
- Why didn't it understand me?            How can I adapt my instructions
- I hope it gives me what I want.         I will guide it to produce exactly what I need

### The 3 Principles of Effective Prompt Engineering:
- 1. Clarity over brevity - Being clear is more important than being concise
  2. Direction over correction - Guide first, then refine
  3. Systems over questions - Build frameworks, not just queries

### Build Example-Driven Systems
- 1. Few-Shot Exercise: Create a few-shot prompt for a classification or categorization task you frequently perform (e.g., categorizing leads, sorting content ideas, evaluating opportunities)
  2. Chain-of-Thought Exercise: Build a reasoning prompt for a complex business decision (e.g., market-entry, resource allocation, strategic prioritization)
  3. Compare Results: Test both methods and document:
  - Quality and depth of analysis
  - Accuracy of conclusions
  - Time saved vs. traditional methods.
